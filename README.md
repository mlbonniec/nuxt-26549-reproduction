# Nuxt 3 Page Duplication on Google Translate

As mentionned in [this issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/26549#issuecomment-2118863146), pages are fully duplicated when loaded from Google Translate.

Unfortunately, Stackblitz preview can't be opened from [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com).
